### Disposition

It is a time to admit the loss. I think I will finally give up on the idea of writing "long, useful, and meaningful" blog posts. Unfortunately, I have a lot of ideas but not enough energy to write them down. As English is not my native language, it takes way too much time to write and even more time to edit and process the text to be readable. Not to mention fully expressing my thoughts in full.

So, from now I will relax and just write some short notes about what I have done and what I have been doing lately. Maybe it'll turn into something meaningful over time. We will see. I will try to do it more regularly as well. I guess it is a win-win situation. For who? I do not know yet.

### Latest projects

The main goal for this summer/fall was to finally get all my current pet projects to v. 1.0.0. Today, I can say that I have achieved this goal. I have released the first versions of all my projects.

- [Villivald.com](https://www.villivald.com/) - I have rebuilt my personal website with Next.js and TypeScipt. Even though I'm not entirely happy with the result, I think it looks better than the previous version.
- [Wishlist](https://wishlist.villivald.com/) - a wishlist app that was on my mind for a while.
- [Koripallopaikat.com](https://koripallopaikat.com/) - made several improvements that may not be visible at first glance but improved the overall experience. Added some new courts as well.

The [shiny new things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiny_object_syndrome) I used while rebuilding those projects above:

- container queries
- :has selector
- css nesting
- logical properties
- css variables (not particularly new, but still)
- dynamic viewport units
- layers

### My learning experience - FrontendMasters x Github

- I created a repo for my Frontend Masters course notes. I have been writing them down in that way for a while, but now I decided to make it public.
- It helps me to methodically go through the courses and retain information. Possibly, it helps other people as those notes are a concentrated summary of great courses on different topics, etc.

### Ideas and plans for the future

- The essence of the project is to build a web app for comparing perfumes based on their chemical composition. At the moment, I am not even sure if it is possible to do it or does it make sense at all. However, it has been on my mind for a while, so I will try to investigate it further.

### Random thoughts

- What I don't like about oklch is, that it looks pretty interesting but has certain drawbacks, such as [this one.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- I am sorry. To be serious, I really don't like it for some reason. And, at the same time, color-mix with oklch is pretty cool ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

The reason? I do not know any rare words.
