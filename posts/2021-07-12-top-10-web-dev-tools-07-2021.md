Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹. My vacation has officially started ðŸ¥³ and I would like to present you the July edition of my [blog post series](https://www.create-react-app.com/tags/top) - Top 10 Best Web Dev Tools. Every month I am trying to pick the most intriguing and handy instruments that, I believe, are must-haves for every web developer. This time there are:

## 1). Next.js

This time I would like to strart with the Next.js, which is really not a tool, but a whole framework with hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. I've wanted to use it in some project for a long time, and finally I did it in my last [project](https://koripallopaikat.vercel.app). Next.js provides you the easiest ways to create API's and work with routing and navigation. I must say t hat the overall developer experience is at the great level, definitely must try.

## 2). Vite

Vite is blazing fast and easy to configure build tool. It uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for bundling, which is written in Go and pre-bundles dependencies 10-100x faster than JavaScript-based bundlers. I recently used Vite in one of my latest [projects](https://vaccine2021.vercel.app/) and I'm currently planning to move my [site](https://villivald.com) to it (from create-react-app incl. webpack).

## 3). Bundlephobia

Bundlephobia is a very useful project that helps you to find the performance impact of npm packages.

## 5). Clippy

Clippy might be the easiest way to create a CSS clip paths. I would also recommend to check out the other projects made by [Bennett Feely](https://bennettfeely.com/) since he has very interesting approaches.

## 6). Material Design icons by Google

Quality icon set by Google. A noteworthy alternative to [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons) or [Material UI Icons](https://material-ui.com/components/material-icons/).

## 9). Snappify

Snappify is an another tool for creating beautiful code snippets. Works almost exactly like [Ray.so](https://ray.so/) that I mentioned in one of my [earlier posts](https://www.create-react-app.com/posts/2021-04-06-top-10-web-dev-tools-04-2021/).

## 10). JS is Weird

Not exactly a tool, but a funny quiz that shows you the weirdest parts of the JavaScript. Somehow I got 16/25 ðŸ˜€. Please share your results in the comments ðŸ¤“.
