Hi everyone, the summer is over, and I'm going back to my usual schedule. So, today I will present you the September 2021 edition of my [blog post series](https://www.create-react-app.com/tags/top) - Top 10 Best Web Dev Tools. Every month I try to pick the most intriguing and handy instruments that, I believe, are must-haves for every web developer. This time there are:

## 1). SolidJS

Today I will start with SolidJS, which is a productivity and performance-based JavaScript framework. I am not going to lie, I have not tried it yet properly, as I was more focused on my [Next.js basketball-related project](https://koripallopaikat.com). Anyway, it seems very impressive and encouraging. It has been for a while on my todo list, and I can wait to try it out.

## 2). Hackr.io

Hackr.io is a platform providing access to a curated collection of different programming courses. It is a great tool to learn overall, as well as get started with web development. Feel free to submit a course or tutorial you like the most (I also plan on doing it sometime soon).

## 3). RAW Graphs

## 5). Slinkity

Slinkity is a plugin that can extend your 11ty project. It allows you to use JS frameworks (React, Vue, and Svelte) for writing page and layout templates. Even though Slinkity is currently in an early alpha state, it is already a very useful tool with an impressive approach.

## 8). This Person Does Not Exist

This Person Does Not Exist is a funny (and a bit creepy) web app that uses AI to generate endless fake faces. It can be useful for projects that need some mock data.
