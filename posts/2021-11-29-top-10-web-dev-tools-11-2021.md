For me, this November was very hectic in all aspects, so I managed to write this post only on the very last day of the month. Nevertheless, let me present you a brand new November 2021 edition of my [blog post series](https://www.create-react-app.com/tags/top) - Top 10 Best Web Dev Tools. Every month I try to pick the most intriguing and handy instruments that, I believe, are must-haves for every web developer. This time there are:

## 1). ssshape

An SVG blob/shape generator with a great UI and intuitive user experience.

## 2). Doodle Ipsum

The lorem ipsum of illustrations. It gives you the possibility to customize your doodles, grab the code, and use it on your web prototypes, landing pages, etc.

## 3). cht.sh

## 5). Couleur

A simple tool to help you create harmonizing color palettes with HSL color values. You should also check an Accessible Palette tool from my [last post](https://www.create-react-app.com/posts/2021-10-19-top-10-web-dev-tools-10-2021/#:~:text=Accessible%20Palette).

## 7). Shadow palette

Actually, this one should be number one on this list. An amazing shadow palette generator by [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) who is also a creator of [CSS for JavaScript Developers](https://css-for-js.dev/) course.

## 8). Netlify Drop
