Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹. Today I would like to present you the brand new August edition of my [blog post series](https://www.create-react-app.com/tags/top) - Top 10 Best Web Dev Tools. Every month I am trying to pick the most intriguing and handy instruments that, I believe, are must-haves for every web developer. This time there are:

## 1). GitHub Copilot

Copilot is an AI tool developed by GitHub to assist users of VS Code. It is still in a Technical Preview state and requires joining the waitlist, but from my experience, I would say that Copilot has all prerequisites to become the Next Big Thing.

## 3). Meta Tags

## 6). Jamstack Explorers

Jamstack Explorers is a learning platform from Netlify. As it is obvious from the title, this platform is dedicated to Jamstack (which stands for JavaScript, API & Markup) related technologies. At the moment they have 9 courses on topics such as Next.js (by [Cassidy Williams](https://twitter.com/cassidoo)), Serverless functions (by [Ben Hong](https://twitter.com/bencodezen)), Nuxt.js & Sanity (by [Ekene Eze](https://twitter.com/kenny_io)), etc.
