This time I would like to present you some of the most memorable tools I've talked about this year. Personally, for me, this year was a year of intensive learning and big changes in my professional life. Anyway, I'm not going to make this blog post too personal. For this purpose, there will be a separate post in January. So, let me finish my [blog post series](https://www.create-react-app.com/tags/top) - Top 10 Best Web Dev Tools. Every month I tried to pick the most intriguing and handy instruments that, I believe, are must-haves for every web developer. Summarizing the results of the year, there are:

## 1). Squoosh

Squoosh is the most intuitive and good-looking image compression web app I have ever seen. It works very fast and supports many formats (AVIF, WebP, JPEG XL, etc.).

## 2). Daily Dev

The best coding news aggregator I have seen so far (yes, including [Hacker News](https://www.create-react-app.com/posts/2020-12-05-15-best-developer-resources-in-2020/)). Available both as a [web app](https://app.daily.dev/) and [extension](https://r.daily.dev/chrome).

## 3). Vercel

A very impressive and easy-to-use deployment and collaboration platform for front-end developers from creators of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). Vercel enables developers to host websites and web services that deploy instantly and scale automatically – all without any configuration. So far, I have been using it for a couple of weeks, and it really feels like a [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) on steroids.

## 4). Eleventy

Eleventy is a well-known and gaining momentum [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/). I have recently moved [my blog](https://www.create-react-app.com/) from WordPress to Eleventy, and it was the best decision to make in terms of performance and accessibility. Here is the [latest Lighthouse score](https://crappblog.netlify.app/blog-on-vercel/) as confirmation of my words.

## 5). Haikei

Haikei is a very inspiring web tool for generating unique SVG shapes, backgrounds, and patterns.

## 6). Vite

Vite is a blazing fast and easy to configure build tool. It uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for bundling, which is written in Go and pre-bundles dependencies 10-100x faster than JavaScript-based bundlers. I recently used Vite in one of my latest [projects](https://vaccine2021.vercel.app/), and I'm currently planning to move my [site](https://villivald.com) to it (from create-react-app incl. webpack).

## 7). GitHub Copilot

Copilot is an AI tool developed by GitHub to assist users of VS Code. It is still in a Technical Preview state and requires joining the waitlist, but from my experience, I would say that Copilot has all prerequisites to become the Next Big Thing.

## 8). Hackr.io

Hackr.io is a platform providing access to a curated collection of different programming courses. It is a great tool to learn overall, as well as get started with web development. Feel free to submit a course or tutorial you like the most (I also plan on doing it sometime soon).

## 9). OpenMoji

An open-source emoji library made by 60+ students and 3 professors of the [HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd](https://www.hfg-gmuend.de/) and 20+ external contributors. I already use some of their brilliant emojis in my [basketball-related project](https://koripallopaikat.com/). They seem like a great alternative to the standard ones.

## 10). cht.sh

This tool is one of my latest findings from [Frontend Masters course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/developer-productivity/). A very useful terminal cheatsheet with a CLI interface.
